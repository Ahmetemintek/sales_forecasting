# Sales Forecasting
In this project we will work with a time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. The aim is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. We have 5 different datasets: <br/>

- Training Data <br/>
- Test Data <br/>
- Items Data <br/>
- Item Categories Data <br/>
- Shops Names Data <br/>
